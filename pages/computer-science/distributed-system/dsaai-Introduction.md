- distributed system
	- multiple process
	- inter process communication
	- disjoint address spaces
		- shared memory？
		- message？
	- collective goal
- Import issues
	- Local knowledge of a process
		- identity：leader/follower？
		- state
		- identity of neighbor
	- Network topology
		- low latency
		- high throughput
	- degree of synchronization
		- clock drift
		- message latency
	- failure
	- scalability
		- base bus: bus is bottleneck
